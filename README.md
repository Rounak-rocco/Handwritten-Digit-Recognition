# Handwritten Digit Recognition
Light weight Deep Learning based software to detect handwritten digits using CNN & Keras (MNIST dataset from Amazon AWS was used to built & train the model).

The following tools/technologies must be installed in the system in order to run this program :
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook (only to edit the model if required)
- Scikit-Learn with NumPy
- Tensorflow with Keras
